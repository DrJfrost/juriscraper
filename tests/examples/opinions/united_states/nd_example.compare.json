A party is not prejudiced by a counsel's improper arguments when the district court instructs the jury not to consider counsel's comments as evidence. A court may grant a new trial on grounds the jury awarded excessive damages appearing to have been awarded under the influence of passion or prejudice. To justify the granting of a new trial, passion and prejudice usually connote anger, resentment, hate, and disregard of the rights of others. When a jury awards excessive damages, under appropriate circumstances, the district court and this Court on appeal, may order a reduction of the verdict instead of a new trial or order that a new trial be had unless the prevailing party remits the excess damages.",

District courts retain authority to revisit interlocutory orders until entry of final judgment.

Absent fraud or mistake, the conveying instrument alone governs determination of the rights of the parties to the transaction. Recordation of a granting instrument is not necessary to effect a conveyance. Nor is it necessary for a plaintiff to present the original conveying instrument to prevail in quiet title action. In a quiet title action ownership may be established through evidence that a conveying instrument was delivered but subsequently lost. The equitable defense of laches may be available when a party delays enforcing his rights and a change in conditions during the delay results in prejudice to an adverse party. To have standing to litigate an issue a party must have suffered some injury from the putatively illegal action and the party must assert his own legal rights and interests and cannot rest his claim on the legal rights and interests of third parties. Parties may contract to a fee recovery standard that is either looser or stricter than statutory standards.",

A district court property division granting one party a net estate of $3,224,357 while assigning them virtually no debt, and the other a net estate of $4,961,915 included all of the debt, almost no liquidity, and no retirement funds, was not clearly erroneous. A district court does not need to consider potential tax implications of a property division when the record failed to support a conclusion that the sale of the property was imminent, failed to indicate the tax liability, or quantified a specific liability to the court. A party is not entitled to an accrual of rent for the use of marital property during the pendency of divorce proceedings absent agreement or seeking district court intervention during the interim. Language in a right to first refusal that does not clarify if the right is triggered by a response to \"any\" offer made to purchase property or if it is triggered by a party's \"acceptance\" of an offer is ambiguous.",
