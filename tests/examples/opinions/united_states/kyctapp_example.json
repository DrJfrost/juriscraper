We dismiss the appeal as being from an interlocutory order.   \r\n \r\n \r\n -2- \r\nFACTS \r\n Kelley Heavener and her dog were attacked by another dog (a pit bull) \r\nwhile walking on Delor Avenue in Louisville.  Heavener was physically injured.  \r\nAnd Heavener�s dog died from injuries suffered in the attack.   \r\n The pit bull was owned by Joseph Carlisle Rogers (�Joseph�).  At that \r\ntime Joseph lived in a house on Delor Avenue owned by his brother, John Norbert \r\nRogers (�John�).  John had insurance on the Delor Avenue home from American \r\nMutual Fire Insurance Company of Kentucky (hereinafter, �American Mutual�).   \r\n Heavener filed suit against Joseph and John in Jefferson Circuit Court \r\n(�the trial court�).  She asserted claims arising from the pit bull attack including \r\nstrict liability, negligence per se for violating local laws requiring owners to \r\ncontrol their pets, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.   \r\n John filed an answer to the complaint, but Joseph did not.  Default \r\njudgment was entered against Joseph with damages to be determined at another \r\nhearing.  American Mutual filed an intervening complaint against John, arguing \r\nthat coverage was excluded.   \r\n John filed a motion for summary judgment on Heavener�s claims, \r\narguing he was not liable for the pit bull attack under Kentucky law.  American \r\nMutual also filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing coverage was excluded.   \r\n -3- \r\n Following briefing and a hearing, the trial court entered an order \r\ngranting summary judgment in John�s favor and dismissing the complaint against \r\nhim.  The order noted it was not final and appealable since Joseph remained in the \r\naction.  A few days later, the trial court also entered an order dismissing American \r\nMutual�s intervening complaint as coverage issues were now moot due to the entry \r\nof summary judgment in John�s favor.   \r\n Shortly thereafter, Heavener filed a motion to amend the summary \r\njudgment granted in John�s favor to make it final and appealable.  The trial court \r\ngranted this motion in a written order, stating that the summary judgment was \r\namended and made �final and appealable� as of the date of the order so that a \r\nmotion to alter, amend, or vacate could be filed within ten days.  (Record on \r\nAppeal, p. 758.)   \r\n Next, Heavener filed a motion to alter, amend, or vacate the summary \r\njudgment granted in John�s favor.  The trial court denied the motion to alter, \r\namend or vacate shortly before Heavener filed her appeal.  The order denying the \r\nmotion to alter, amend, or vacate did not state that it was final or that there was no \r\njust cause for delay.   \r\n To sum up, neither the original summary judgment granted in John�s \r\nfavor, the order amending the summary judgment order to supposedly make it final \r\n -4- \r\nand appealable, nor the order denying the motion to alter, amend, or vacate stated \r\nthat there was no just reason for delay.  See CR1 54.02(1).   \r\n CR 54.01 states:  �A final or appealable judgment is a final order \r\nadjudicating all the rights of all the parties in an action or proceeding, or a \r\njudgment made final under Rule 54.02.�  CR 54.02(1) states in pertinent part:  \r\nthe court may grant a final judgment upon one or more \r\nbut less than all of the claims or parties only upon a \r\ndetermination that there is no just reason for delay. \r\nThe judgment shall recite such determination and shall \r\nrecite that the judgment is final.  In the absence of such \r\nrecital, any order or other form of decision, however \r\ndesignated, which adjudicates less than all the claims or \r\nthe rights and liabilities of less than all the parties shall \r\nnot terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, \r\nand the order or other form of decision is interlocutory \r\nand subject to revision at any time before the entry of \r\njudgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and \r\nliabilities of all the parties. \r\n \r\n(Emphasis added.)   \r\n The summary judgment granted in John�s favor did not resolve all the \r\nrights of all the parties in the action.  Specifically, it did not resolve Heavener�s \r\nclaims against Joseph.",
                        "Admittedly, the trial court did resolve American Mutual�s \r\nrights by a separate order dismissing the intervening complaint which was rendered \r\nafter the original summary judgment order and before the order amending the \r\nsummary judgment order.  See CR 54.02(2).  But the trial court had not adjudicated \r\n \r\n1 Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure.   \r\n -5- \r\nall of Heavener�s or Joseph�s rights in the action since damages remained to be \r\ndetermined on Heavener�s claims against Joseph.  So, no order entered in this case \r\nfully adjudicated all the rights of all the parties in the action.  See CR 54.01.   \r\n In addition to none of the trial court�s orders being inherently final \r\nand appealable under CR 54.01 since they did not fully adjudicate all rights of all \r\nparties in the action, none of the trial court�s orders adjudicating less than all the \r\nrights of all parties stated both that the order was final and that there was no just \r\nreason for delay.  So, these orders were interlocutory and subject to revision \r\npursuant to CR 54.02(1).2  \r\n Perhaps it may seem hyper-technical and not in the interest of judicial \r\neconomy to dismiss an appeal from an order which a trial court expressly deems \r\nfinal and appealable simply because there is no statement that there is no just cause \r\nfor delay.  Nonetheless, binding precedent calls for dismissal of an appeal from an \r\norder adjudicating less than all the rights of all the parties in an action when the \r\ntrial court has not determined there is no just reason for delay even when the trial \r\ncourt has deemed its order final and appealable. \r\n \r\n2 Nor does CR 54.02(2) apply here since there has been no judgment fully disposing of \r\nHeavener�s claims against Joseph as damages must still be determined.  See CR 54.02(2) (�When \r\nthe remaining claim or claims in a multiple claim action are disposed of by judgment, that \r\njudgment shall be deemed to readjudicate finally as of that date and in the same terms all prior \r\ninterlocutory orders and judgments determining claims which are not specifically disposed of in \r\nsuch final judgment.�).   \r\n -6- \r\n For example, in Hale v. Deaton, 528 S.W.2d 719 (Ky. 1975), the trial \r\ncourt entered an order denying a motion for modification of an underlying \r\njudgment and stating:  �The Judgment entered herein, and this Order are final and \r\nappealable Orders and Judgment of the Court.�  Id. at 721.  The Kentucky court \r\ndismissed the appeal because the underlying judgment did not adjudicate all rights \r\nof all parties in the action and because the order denying modification did not state \r\nthere was no just cause for delay.  The Kentucky court noted that both statements \r\nthat an order or judgment was final and that there was no just reason for delay were \r\nexpressly required by CR 54.02(1) to permit an appeal from an order or judgment \r\nnot adjudicating all the rights of all the parties in the action.  And it stated that \r\nfailure to make both required statements � of finality and of there being no just \r\nreason for delay � was �fatal.�  Id. at 722.   \r\n Kentucky precedent has long required strict compliance with CR \r\n54.02 requirements to make an otherwise interlocutory order adjudicating less than \r\nall the rights of all the parties in the action final and appealable.  See Peters v. \r\nBoard of Ed. of Hardin Cnty., 378 S.W.2d 638, 639 (Ky. 1964).  We must follow \r\nsuch binding precedent from the Kentucky Supreme Court and its predecessor \r\ncourt, SCR3 1.030(8)(a), despite any arguments that such a strict compliance \r\napproach to CR 54.02 is hyper-technical or not in the interest of judicial economy.   \r\n \r\n3 Kentucky Supreme Court Rules.   \r\n -7- \r\n In short, we dismiss this appeal sua sponte because the appeal is from \r\nan interlocutory order due to lack of strict compliance with CR 54.02 requirements \r\n� specifically the lack of required �no just reason for delay� statement � and \r\nbecause we lack jurisdiction over appeals from interlocutory orders.  See Peters, \r\n378 S.W.2d at 639-40 (dismissing appeal sua sponte as an appellate court may \r\nproperly raise issues about jurisdiction itself and would lack authority to decide an \r\nappeal from an order which �failed to contain the recitals required by CR 54.02 so \r\nas to invest this Court with jurisdiction over the appeal�).   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n WHEREFORE, the above-styled appeal shall be, and hereby is, \r\nDISMISSED for failure to appeal from a final and appealable order. \r\n \r\n ALL CONCUR. \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nENTERED: _March 29, 2024___ \r\n \r\n \r\nJUDGE, COURT OF APPEALS \r\n \r\n \r\nBRIEF FOR APPELLANT: \r\n \r\nNolia G.

Bernheim Foundation (�Bernheim�) appeals from \r\nan interlocutory judgment finding Louisville Gas and Electric Company (�LG&E�) \r\nhas the right to condemn Bernheim�s property for a natural gas pipeline.  Finding \r\nno error, we affirm.  \r\n -2- \r\n LG&E is a public utility that provides natural gas service in Bullitt \r\nCounty, Kentucky.  To increase supply and facilitate expansion, LG&E is \r\nconstructing an underground natural gas pipeline.  Part of the pipeline runs through \r\nproperty owned by Bernheim, 494 acres of land known as the Cedar Grove \r\nWildlife Corridor (�Simon Tracts�).  LG&E attempted to purchase an easement \r\nfrom Bernheim but when negotiations were unsuccessful, initiated a condemnation \r\nproceeding under the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky (KRS1 278.502). \r\n Bernheim owns a nature preserve in Bullitt and Nelson Counties.  In \r\n2018, Bernheim purchased the Simon Tracts with grant money from the Kentucky \r\nHeritage Land Conservation Fund (�Fund�).2  As a condition of the grant, \r\nBernheim was required to convey to the Commonwealth �a conservation easement \r\nin perpetuity over all land acquired, in whole or in part, with fund proceeds.�  418 \r\nKAR3 1:050 � 6(1).  Another stipulation was that the land must be maintained for \r\nthe conservation purpose for which it was acquired.  418 KAR 1:050 � 6(1)(b); \r\nKRS 146.560(2). \r\n \r\n1 Kentucky Revised Statutes.  \r\n \r\n2 The grant from the Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund provided half the purchase \r\nprice and a grant from the Imperiled Bat Conservation Fund, administered by the United States \r\nFish and Wildlife Service, supplied the balance.  \r\n \r\n3 Kentucky Administrative Regulations.  \r\n -3- \r\n In the condemnation action, Bernheim challenged LG&E�s right to \r\ntake, arguing it lacked authority to condemn property that is statutorily dedicated to \r\npublic conservation use and encumbered by a government-held conservation \r\neasement.4  Following an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court found in LG&E�s \r\nfavor, granting it an interlocutory judgment pursuant to KRS 416.610.  This appeal \r\nfollowed.  \r\n �Since this case was tried before the circuit court without a jury, we \r\nreview the trial court�s factual findings under a clearly erroneous standard and the \r\nlegal issues de novo.�  God�s Center Foundation, Inc. v. Lexington Fayette Urban \r\nCnty. Government, 125 S.W.3d 295, 300 (Ky. App. 2002).  On appeal, Bernheim \r\ndoes not raise the standard challenges to a condemnor�s right to take, such as \r\nnecessity, public use, and reasonable compensation, but instead makes several \r\narguments concerning LG&E�s right to take based upon the existence of the \r\nCommonwealth�s conservation easement.  Specifically, Bernheim argues:  (1) \r\nLG&E cannot condemn property that has been put to a prior public use; (2) \r\nLG&E�s power to condemn is limited to private property; (3) the previous Court of \r\nAppeals� decision did not determine the issues on appeal; and (4) KRS 382.850(2) \r\n \r\n4 Bernheim made other challenges to LG&E�s right to take below, but does not raise them on \r\nappeal; therefore, we do not recite them here.   \r\n -4- \r\ndoes not make a government conservation easement pursuant to KRS Chapter 146 \r\na legal fiction.   \r\n As alluded to above, this is the second time this case has been on \r\nappeal.  In Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund Board v. Louisville Gas \r\nand Electric Company, 648 S.W.3d 76, 78 (Ky. App. 2022), discretionary review \r\ndenied (Aug. 10, 2022), a panel of this Court held that sovereign immunity did not \r\npreclude LG&E from condemning property subject to a state-owned easement.  In \r\nthat appeal, the Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund Board (�Board�) was \r\nthe appellant, and Bernheim filed a brief in support of the Board�s position.  The \r\nBoard made essentially the same arguments Bernheim now makes, and our Court \r\nconsidered and rejected them.  We believe Kentucky Heritage is dispositive of the \r\nissues in this appeal; nevertheless, to be thorough, we address Bernheim�s \r\narguments individually.   \r\n Bernheim first argues condemnation is prohibited by the prior public \r\nuse doctrine.  It cites the general rule that �land devoted to one public use cannot \r\nbe taken for another public use in the absence of express legislative authority for \r\nthe taking.�  Jefferson Cnty. By and Through Hollenbach v.",
                        "South Central Bell Tel. \r\nCo., 555 S.W.2d 629, 632 (Ky. App. 1977).  Bernheim claims the Simon Tracts are \r\nalready devoted to public use because they were purchased with public funds and \r\nmust be maintained for public conservation purposes.  Thus, LG&E cannot \r\n -5- \r\ncondemn the property for another public use because it lacks express legislative \r\nauthority.  Bernheim acknowledges we previously �rejected the argument . . . that \r\nLG&E lacked the power of condemnation under the �prior public use� doctrine[.]�  \r\nIn the prior appeal, we held that �the plain language of KRS 382.850(2) authorizes \r\na statutory right of eminent domain to prevail over a conservation easement \r\nbecause a conservation easement is assumed not to exist upon the exercise of a \r\nstatutory right of eminent domain.  If it is assumed that the Board�s conservation \r\neasement does not exist, then there is no prior public use to impede the exercise of \r\nLG&E�s right of eminent domain.�  Kentucky Heritage, 648 S.W.3d at 89. \r\n Nevertheless, it claims we �misapprehended th[e] significant \r\ndistinction� that the prior public use arises not from KRS 382.850(2), but from \r\nKRS 146.560 and 146.570.  Bernheim seeks to avoid our prior holding by \r\nsidestepping KRS 382.850(2).  Its argument goes like this:  KRS Chapter 146 \r\nrequires property acquired with Fund monies to be maintained in perpetuity for \r\npublic conservation purposes � a public use.  However, the statute does not \r\nreference KRS Chapter 382 or require that this be done through a conservation \r\neasement.  Because KRS Chapter 146 was enacted after KRS Chapter 382, this \r\nomission must be intentional.  The public use arising under KRS Chapter 146 is \r\ndifferent than the one arising under a conservation easement.  Thus, KRS Chapter \r\n382 is simply not relevant.  Since KRS Chapter 146 does not explicitly allow \r\n -6- \r\ncondemnation of land or property interests acquired under its provisions, LG&E \r\nlacks express legislative authority for the taking.  \r\n Though creative, we find its argument unconvincing.  The simple fact \r\nis the conservation easement exists; thus KRS 382.850(2), which governs \r\nconservation easements, applies.  The General Assembly mandated the Board \r\nadminister the Fund and gave them authority to promulgate regulations to \r\naccomplish its purpose.5  Pursuant to 418 KAR 1:050 � 6(1), Bernheim conveyed \r\nto the Commonwealth a conservation easement when it purchased the Simon \r\nTracts with Fund proceeds.  The regulation explicitly states �[t]he conservation \r\neasement shall meet the requirements of KRS 382.800 through 382.860 and ensure \r\nthat lands acquired shall be maintained in perpetuity for the purposes established \r\nin KRS 146.560.�  418 KAR 1:050 � 6(1)(b). \r\n As much as Bernheim would like to distance KRS Chapter 146 from \r\nKRS Chapter 382, the regulation explicitly links the two.  The land LG&E seeks to \r\ncondemn is burdened by a conservation easement and KRS 382.850(2) is \r\napplicable.  �Under KRS 382.850(2), a conservation easement �shall not operate to \r\nimpair or restrict any right or power of eminent domain created by statute, and all \r\nsuch rights and powers shall be exercisable as if the conservation easement did not \r\n \r\n5 Technically, KRS 146.560 states the Energy and Environmental Cabinet �may promulgate \r\nupon recommendation of the board in accordance with the provisions of KRS Chapter 13A \r\nadministrative regulations as are deemed necessary . . . .�  KRS 146.560(2) (emphasis added).  \r\n -7- \r\nexist.��  Kentucky Heritage, 648 S.W.3d at 85-86.  �If it is assumed that the \r\nBoard�s conservation easement does not exist, then there is no prior public use to \r\nimpede the exercise of LG&E�s right of eminent domain.�  Id. at 89. \r\n Bernheim next asserts LG&E�s power to condemn is limited to private \r\nproperty.  It notes LG&E�s authority to condemn comes from KRS 278.502 and \r\nKRS 416.540-416.680, the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky.  The Act \r\nspecifically defines �condemn� as to �to take private property for a public use \r\nunder the right of eminent domain[.]�  KRS 416.540(1) (emphasis added).  \r\nBernheim further argues KRS 382.850(2) does not enlarge the power of eminent \r\ndomain.  Therefore, because the Act limits condemnation to private property and \r\nKRS 382.850(2) does not expand that power, Bernheim claims LG&E lacks \r\nstatutory authority to condemn a publicly held conservation easement.   \r\n We considered and rejected this argument in Kentucky Heritage.  \r\nThere, we held  \r\n[w]hile LG&E may not have the general power to \r\ncondemn public property under KRS 278.502 and KRS \r\n416.540(1), KRS 382.850(2) expresses the Legislature�s \r\nintention that a conservation easement cannot be used to \r\nimpede the exercise of any statutory power of eminent \r\ndomain that the Legislature has otherwise conferred by \r\nstatute.",
                        "If the existence of the conservation easement is \r\ndisregarded, as KRS 382.850(2) instructs, then LG&E \r\nwould undoubtedly have the power to condemn the \r\nproperty at issue. \r\n \r\n -8- \r\nKentucky Heritage, 648 S.W.3d at 88.  If the conservation easement is disregarded, \r\nthe Simon Tracts are simply private property � any public property interest \r\ndisappears.  \r\n Bernheim next maintains Kentucky Heritage did not determine the \r\nissues in this appeal.  It rightly notes Kentucky Heritage was limited to whether \r\nsovereign immunity precludes �commencement of condemnation proceedings \r\nagainst the holder of a conservation easement.�  Kentucky Heritage, 648 S.W.3d at \r\n78-79.  But it then reads too much into that language.  Focusing on the word \r\n�commencement[,]� it contends KRS 382.850(2) allows �commencement of an \r\naction for condemnation as against [a] government-held easement but is \r\ninsufficient to allow [the] taking of that interest absent some statutory \r\nauthorization.�  \r\n Although we did not reach the issue of LG&E�s right to take in \r\nKentucky Heritage, we interpreted KRS 382.850(2) as subjecting �a conservation \r\neasement held by a governmental entity . . . [to] eminent domain.�  Id. at 86.  KRS \r\n382.850(2) provides �[a] conservation easement . . . shall not operate to impair or \r\nrestrict any right or power of eminent domain . . . and all such rights and powers \r\nshall be exercisable as if the conservation easement did not exist.�  The statute \r\nauthorizes the exercise of �all . . . rights and powers [of eminent domain].�  Id.  It \r\ndoes not limit exercise to just the commencement of condemnation proceedings.  \r\n -9- \r\nIn sum, while Kentucky Heritage did not specifically address the relevant issue in \r\nthis appeal � whether LG&E has the right to take Bernheim�s property � its \r\ninterpretation of KRS 382.850(2) foreclosed Bernheim�s argument that a \r\ngovernment-held easement cannot be condemned. \r\n Relatedly, Bernheim contends Kentucky Heritage is not the law of the \r\ncase concerning LG&E�s right to condemn the conservation easement.  �The law \r\nof the case doctrine means issues decided in earlier appeals should not be revisited \r\nin subsequent ones.�  Armstrong v. Estate of Elmore, 647 S.W.3d 214, 217 (Ky. \r\n2022) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  It �designates the principle \r\nthat if an appellate court has passed on a legal question . . . the legal questions thus \r\ndetermined by the appellate court will not be differently determined on a \r\nsubsequent appeal in the same case.�  Inman v. Inman, 648 S.W.2d 847, 849 (Ky. \r\n1982). \r\n Again, while we agree Kentucky Heritage did not determine LG&E�s \r\nright to take Bernheim�s property, its statutory interpretation of KRS 382.850(2) \r\nsettled the legal arguments Bernheim advances on appeal.  Thus, while our \r\nprevious opinion is not the law of the case as to LG&E�s right to take, its analysis \r\nof KRS 382.850(2) is.  We note that even if Kentucky Heritage�s statutory \r\ninterpretation were not the law of the case, we would be persuaded by its reasoning \r\nand analysis.  Regardless, as it pertains to Bernheim�s arguments on appeal, we \r\n -10- \r\nhold that KRS 382.850(2) removes any �issue of the Commonwealth�s ownership \r\ninterest in the conservation easement . . . as an obstacle to the pursuit of \r\ncondemnation proceedings by a party with a statutory right of eminent domain.�  \r\nKentucky Heritage, 648 S.W.3d at 86. \r\n Finally, Bernheim argues KRS 382.850(2) does not make a \r\ngovernment conservation easement under KRS Chapter 146 a legal fiction.  Again, \r\nBernheim disagrees with this Court�s interpretation of KRS 382.850(2) in \r\nKentucky Heritage that �[b]y employing the legal fiction that a conservation \r\neasement does not exist upon the exercise of a statutory power of eminent domain, \r\nthe General Assembly expressed its intention that a conservation easement held by \r\na governmental entity is subject to the exercise of any statutory power of eminent \r\ndomain.�  Kentucky Heritage, 648 S.W.3d at 86.  Because the sole issue on appeal \r\nwas sovereign immunity, it argues this Court �did not delve into the thorny \r\nconstitutional questions raised by a suggestion that the General Assembly could, \r\nby legislative fiat, actually extinguish a conservation easement held by the \r\nCommonwealth of Kentucky.�  Bernheim suggests that KRS 382.850(2) should \r\ninstead be read as a savings clause, doing �nothing more than ordering the \r\nrelationship of eminent domain powers to the existence of such an easement.� \r\n The Board made a similar argument in Kentucky Heritage, claiming \r\n�KRS 382.850(2) merely preserves the right of eminent domain and subjects \r\n -11- \r\nconservation easements to the right of eminent domain[.]�  648 S.W.3d at 86.",
                        "But \r\nas we noted there, such an interpretation �does not give full effect to the provision \r\nin KRS 382.850(2) that any statutory right of eminent domain �shall be exercisable \r\nas if the conservation easement did not exist.��  Id.  �[A] statute should be \r\nconstrued, if possible, so that no part of its provisions are rendered meaningless.�  \r\nBob Hook Chevrolet Isuzu, Inc. v. Commonwealth Transp. Cabinet, 983 S.W.2d \r\n488, 492 (Ky. 1998) (citation omitted).   \r\n We believe our analysis in that appeal is conclusive: \r\nIn KRS 382.850(2), the use of the phrase, �all such rights \r\nand powers shall be exercisable as if the conservation \r\neasement did not exist[,]� appears to be a unique \r\nmodification of the Uniform Conservation Easement Act \r\n(UCEA).  The text of the UCEA does not address the \r\nissue of whether a conservation easement can be \r\ncondemned through eminent domain.  However, the \r\npreface to the 2007 version provides that �the Act neither \r\nlimits nor enlarges the power of eminent domain[,]� \r\ninstead leaving �the scope of that power� to �the \r\nadopting state�s eminent domain code and related \r\nstatutes.�  See Nat�l Conf. of Comm�rs on Unif. State L., \r\nPrefatory Note at 4 to Uniform Conservation Easement \r\nAct (1981) (amended 2007).  Unlike other jurisdictions, \r\nthe Kentucky General Assembly did not adopt any \r\nlanguage from the preface to the UCEA concerning the \r\nenlargement of eminent domain. . . . \r\n \r\nThis Court cannot endorse an interpretation that \r\nsimply ignores a portion of the statutory text. . . .  [T]he \r\nGeneral Assembly specifically added these words to the \r\nstatute contrary to the language set out in the preface and \r\ntext of the Uniform Conservation Easement Act and \r\ncomparable statutes enacted by other jurisdictions.  The \r\n -12- \r\nLegislature is presumed to be aware of existing laws \r\nwhen enacting a new statute.  Pearce v. University of \r\nLouisville, by and through its Bd. of Trustees, 448 \r\nS.W.3d 746, 760 (Ky. 2014). \r\n \r\nKentucky Heritage, 648 S.W.3d at 86-87.   \r\n Finally, Bernheim submits that if we hold LG&E does not have the \r\nright to take the conservation easement, we should hold �[LG&E] has no good \r\nfaith basis to take the underlying property encumbered by the conservation \r\neasement, as the conservation easement specifically prevents the development of \r\ngas pipelines on the subject property.�  Because we hold the circuit court did not \r\ncommit any error in granting the interlocutory judgment, we need not address this \r\nargument.  \r\n Based upon the foregoing, Bullitt Circuit Court�s interlocutory \r\njudgment is affirmed.  \r\n \r\n ALL CONCUR.  \r\n \r\n -13- \r\nBRIEFS FOR APPELLANT: \r\n \r\nRandal A.

For the reasons stated herein, \r\nwe reverse the Bourbon Circuit Court�s order and remand for proceedings \r\nconsistent with this Opinion. \r\n -2- \r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n The Dixons and the Turleys own adjoining properties in Bourbon \r\nCounty, Kentucky, which share a common boundary line marked by a fence.  The \r\nDixons� property sits at a higher elevation than the Turleys� property, which causes \r\nwater to flow under the shared fence from the Dixons� property to the Turleys� \r\nproperty.   \r\n On February 27, 2018, Ms. Dixon filed a complaint against Mr. \r\nTurley and his son, Steven Austin Clay Turley, in the Bourbon District Court, \r\nSmall Claims Division (the �First Action�).  Ms. Dixon alleged that by filling a \r\nditch on the Turleys� property, the Turleys caused unnatural pooling and mud on \r\nthe parties� boundary line.  Ms. Dixon asserted claims of (1) destruction of \r\nproperty, (2) harassment, (3) emotional distress, (4) interference with the \r\nproductivity of the farm, and (5) interference with the quality of life.  Following a \r\nbench trial on April 10, 2018, the Bourbon District Court entered judgment for the \r\nTurleys.  Ms. Dixon did not appeal the outcome of the First Action. \r\n Less than one year later, on January 15, 2019, George and Tina Dixon \r\nfiled a second action against Mr. Turley in the Bourbon District Court, Small \r\nClaims Division (the �Second Action�).  In their complaint, the Dixons alleged \r\nprivate nuisance based on the following:  \r\n[Mr. Turley] . . . [h]as caused ongoing damages to the \r\nsecondary Fence which is attached to the main fence.  He \r\n -3- \r\nis intentionally pushing the fence out with his shoes.  \r\nThis causes us to have to repair it one or two times a \r\nweek.  We have fencing all around our property.  In the \r\npast ten years no maintenance has been needed to any of \r\nour boundary fences except the continuous weekly \r\nrepairs along the Turley side.   \r\n \r\nOver the past two years we�ve noticed the run off from \r\nour other neighbor�s land backing up on our property.  \r\nUpon closer inspection we discovered the natural flow of \r\nthe water had been blocked by Mr. Turley causing the \r\nwater to stagnate.  When it rained the swirling water dug \r\na hole two and a half feet deep.  We had to add concrete \r\nand rocks to one fence pole in order to protect it from \r\nfurther damage.  In the past year [Mr. Turley] \r\nintentionally added concrete slab (on his property) in the \r\npath of the water and begun packing dirt and gravel on \r\nand around it.  Now the water is backing up on our \r\nproperty again.  Leaving stagnant water and mud in it�s \r\n[sic] wake.  \r\n \r\n On February 12, 2019, the Bourbon District Court held another bench \r\ntrial.  However, the only evidence the Dixons brought to the trial for the Second \r\nAction was the evidence presented to the district court in the First Action.   \r\n Following the trial, the Bourbon District Court again entered \r\njudgment in favor of the Turleys.  The district court noted in its order that the \r\nDixons were �complain[ing] of the same issues that were adjudicated� in the First \r\nAction and that some of the pictures filed at the hearing pre-dated the First \r\nAction�s complaint.    \r\n -4- \r\n The Dixons appealed the district court�s finding in favor of the \r\nTurleys in the Second Action to the Bourbon Circuit Court on February 22, 2019.  \r\nThe circuit court entered an order on March 9, 2020, affirming the district court.   \r\nThe circuit court upheld the district court�s holding concerning the private nuisance \r\nclaim of water diversion and pooling, explaining that the �Dixons did not present \r\nany evidence to support the claim that the value of [their] property was any less \r\nbecause of the alleged damage to the fence or the standing water, beyond mere \r\nallegations.�  In reviewing the evidence supporting the allegation that Mr. Turley \r\ndamaged the fence by repeatedly rubbing his foot on the fence, urinating on the \r\nfence, and running his truck into the fence, the circuit court stated that �[t]here was \r\nno proof that the damage to the fence was by Mr. Turley.�   \r\n Although there was proof that Mr. Turley ran his truck into the fence, \r\nthe circuit court reasoned that the record and testimony at trial revealed Mr.",
                        "Turley \r\nfully repaired the damage.  Lastly, the circuit court also upheld the district court�s \r\ndismissal of the Dixons� claim for damages associated with �medical costs, weight \r\ngain, emotional distress, and slander� because the Dixons �failed to make a \r\nconnection between these claims� and the Turleys� alleged conduct.    \r\n The Dixons filed the instant complaint against the Turleys on May 17, \r\n2021.  Specifically, the Dixons claimed that Mr. Turley had, since April 2020, \r\n�placed fill materials in, plugged, clogged and diverted natural water ways and \r\n -5- \r\ndrainage ditches which flow upon, onto and across his property which block and/or \r\ndivert the natural flow and drainage of water.�  The complaint further alleged that, \r\nsince April 2020, Mr. Turley had �constructed buildings, altered the construction \r\nof such buildings and/or altered the lots upon which such building are constructed \r\nso as to direct and/or redirect the natural flow of rain and storm water[.]�  They \r\nclaimed that the preceding actions constituted a �constant and continuing trespass� \r\nas well as a �constant and continuing private nuisance.�   \r\n The Dixons also requested injunctive relief from the circuit court \r\nrequiring Mr. Turley �to remove the fill and other obstructions which now block \r\nand/or divert the natural flow of water[;]� �redirect the flow of rain water and \r\nstorm water off of the buildings and building lots on his property� away from the \r\nDixons� property; and to prohibit the Turleys �from making any changes to or \r\nupon their property in the future which blocks, diverts or alters the natural flow of \r\nwater[.]� \r\n Additionally, the Dixons requested a temporary and permanent \r\nrestraining order prohibiting Mr. Turley and his family from communicating with \r\nthe Dixons and entering the Dixons� property.  They further requested damages for \r\nMs. Dixon�s mental and emotional pain and suffering.   \r\n On June 8, 2021, the Turleys filed a motion to dismiss under \r\nKentucky Rule of Civil Procedure (�CR�) 12.02 for failure to state a claim upon \r\n -6- \r\nwhich relief may be granted under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral \r\nestoppel.  The Bourbon Circuit Court granted the motion in an order dated \r\nNovember 10, 2022.  In its order, the circuit court held that the Dixons� claims \r\nwere barred by claim preclusion and issue preclusion.  Thereafter, the Dixons filed \r\nthe present appeal. \r\nANALYSIS \r\n The Dixons� brief deviates from the formatting and substance \r\nrequirements of the Rules of Appellate Procedure (�RAP�) by failing to \r\nincorporate preservation statements or citations to the record.  Even pro se litigants \r\n� like the Dixons � are expected to file briefs that demonstrate a �good faith \r\nattempt to comport� with the briefing requirements of RAP 32.  Hallis v. Hallis, \r\n328 S.W.3d 694, 698 (Ky. App. 2010) (considering CR 76.12, the predecessor to \r\nRAP 32). \r\n �Our options when an appellate advocate fails to abide by the rules \r\nare:  (1) to ignore the deficiency and proceed with the review; (2) to strike the brief \r\nor its offending portions, [RAP 31(H)(1)]; or (3) to review the issues raised in the \r\nbrief for manifest injustice only[.]�  Id. at 696 (citation omitted).  In this case, \r\nbecause the record is small and we have been able to determine whether the \r\nDixons properly preserved their arguments, we will ignore the deficiency and \r\nproceed with the review. \r\n -7- \r\n We also note that the Dixons� brief includes issues and arguments not \r\nripe for this Court�s review.  Appellate courts are �without authority to review \r\nissues not raised in or decided by the trial court� and may not �consider any claim \r\nor contention which is based upon a portion of the record below that has not been \r\nmade part of the record before the appellate court.�  Norton Healthcare, Inc. v. \r\nDeng, 487 S.W.3d 846, 852 (Ky. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citations \r\nomitted); RAP 25(B).  Because �there can be no error� where an issue was never \r\n�presented to the trial court for decision,� this appeal is limited to whether the \r\nBourbon Circuit Court appropriately applied the doctrine of res judicata.  Deng, \r\n487 S.W.3d at 852. \r\n1. Standard of Review \r\n Turning to the applicable standard of review in this case, CR 12.02(f) \r\noutlines the following for a trial court�s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state \r\na claim: \r\nThe court should not grant the motion unless it appears \r\nthe pleading party would not be entitled to relief under \r\nany set of facts which could be proved in support of his \r\nclaim.  In making this decision, the circuit court is not \r\nrequired to make any factual determination; rather, the \r\nquestion is purely a matter of law.  Stated another way, \r\nthe court must ask if the facts alleged in the complaint \r\ncan be proved, would the plaintiff be entitled to relief? \r\n \r\nJames v. Wilson, 95 S.W.3d 875, 883-84 (Ky. App. 2002) (internal quotation \r\nmarks and footnotes omitted).",
                        "We review dismissals under CR 12.02(f) de novo, \r\n -8- \r\naccepting the plaintiff�s factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable \r\ninferences in the plaintiff�s favor.  Gall v. Scroggy, 725 S.W.2d 867, 868-69 (Ky. \r\nApp. 1987); Pike v. George, 434 S.W.2d 626, 627 (Ky. 1968) (�For the purpose of \r\ntesting the sufficiency of the complaint the pleading must not be construed against \r\nthe pleader and the allegations must be accepted as true.�). \r\n2. Discussion  \r\n The Dixons argue that the Bourbon Circuit Court erred in granting the \r\nTurleys� motion to dismiss based on res judicata and collateral estoppel.  Res \r\njudicata is an affirmative defense that �operates to bar repetitious suits involving \r\nthe same cause of action[,]� and involves �two subparts:  1) claim preclusion and \r\n2) issue preclusion.�  Yeoman v. Commonwealth, Health Policy Bd., 983 S.W.2d \r\n459, 464-65 (Ky. 1998).  �Claim preclusion bars a party from re[]litigating a \r\npreviously adjudicated cause of action and entirely bars a new lawsuit on the same \r\ncause of action.�  Id. at 465 (citations omitted).  Alternatively, �[i]ssue preclusion \r\nbars the parties from relitigating any issue actually litigated and finally decided in \r\nan earlier action.  The issues in the former and latter actions must be identical.�  Id.    \r\n Under Kentucky law, �[t]he key inquiry in deciding whether the \r\nlawsuits concern the same controversy is whether they both arise from the same \r\ntransactional nucleus of facts.�  Id.  If the suits �concern the same controversy, \r\n -9- \r\nthen the previous suit is deemed to have adjudicated every matter which was or \r\ncould have been brought in support of the cause of action.�  Id. (citations omitted).   \r\n Claim preclusion applies when three elements are present: identity of \r\nthe parties, identity of the causes of action, and the action must have been resolved \r\non the merits.  Id. (citations omitted).  For issue preclusion to apply, the issues \r\nmust have been (1) the same in both cases, (2) actually litigated in the first case, \r\n(3) actually decided in the first case, and (4) necessary to the court�s judgment in \r\nthe first case.  Id. (citations omitted).   \r\n In this case, the circuit court erred in granting the Turleys� motion to \r\ndismiss based on claim preclusion because, based on the pleadings, the subject \r\nmatter of the subsequent suit was not identical to that in the former suits.  \r\nSpecifically, the �transactional nucleus of facts� that generated the second \r\ncomplaint allegedly occurred after the district court�s judgment in the Second \r\nAction.  As the Kentucky Supreme Court has stated, �[o]rdinarily, when new \r\nevents transpire, a plaintiff would supplement the original complaint under CR \r\n15.04.  But if the plaintiff failed to do so, those claims would not be barred by res \r\njudicata, because the events transpired after the filing of the original complaint.�  \r\nCoomer v. CSX Transp., Inc., 319 S.W.3d 366, 373 (Ky. 2010).   \r\n In their complaint to the circuit court, the Dixons tailored their \r\nallegations of damages, continuing trespass, and continuing nuisance to events \r\n -10- \r\noccurring �[s]ince April of 2020.�  Thus, these constitute new allegations of events \r\nthat �transpired after the filing� of the complaints in both the First Action and \r\nSecond Action and the district court�s judgments.  Id. \r\n Moreover, while the Dixons requested monetary damages in their \r\nsmall claims suit, they requested injunctive relief and restraining orders in their \r\ncomplaint to the circuit court.  Claim preclusion does not apply where: \r\n[t]he plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of \r\nthe case or to seek a certain remedy or form of relief in \r\nthe first action because of the limitations on the subject \r\nmatter jurisdiction of the courts . . . and the plaintiff \r\ndesires in the second action to rely on that theory or to \r\nseek that remedy or form of relief. \r\n \r\nMiller v. Administrative Office of Courts, 361 S.W.3d 867, 873 (Ky. 2011) \r\n(citation omitted).    \r\n Thus, in �drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff�s favor,� \r\nwhile some of the general circumstances of the successive suits were the same, the \r\nspecific, pertinent transactional nucleus of facts was not.  Gall, 725 S.W.2d at 868-\r\n69.  Indeed, the circuit court suit would require the production of different proof, \r\nand the Dixons� requested remedies were unique to the circuit court litigation.  See \r\nArnold v. K-Mart Corp., 747 S.W.2d 130, 132-33 (Ky. App. 1988).  \r\n We next turn to the circuit court�s dismissal based on issue preclusion \r\nor collateral estoppel.  Again, �[f]or purposes of an issue preclusion analysis, we \r\nmust compare the two adjudications to determine if they involve the same \r\n -11- \r\ncontroversy,� that is, �whether they both arise from the same transactional nucleus \r\nof facts.�  Chesley v. Abbott, 524 S.W.3d 471, 483 (Ky. App. 2017) (citation \r\nomitted).",
                        "As previously discussed, however, because the Dixons� present suit is \r\nalleging action by the Turleys that occurred after the Second Action�s judgment, as \r\nwell as requesting injunctive relief, the issues are not identical and there is no issue \r\npreclusion.     \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n In sum, the circuit court erred in dismissing the Dixons� complaint \r\nunder CR 12.02(f) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the Bourbon Circuit Court�s November 10, 2022, order \r\nand remand for additional proceedings consistent with this decision. \r\n \r\n GOODWINE, JUDGE, CONCURS. \r\n MCNEILL, JUDGE, DISSENTS AND DOES NOT FILE \r\nSEPARATE OPINION. \r\n \r\nBRIEFS FOR APPELLANTS: \r\n \r\nGeorge and Tina Dixon, pro se \r\nParis, Kentucky \r\n \r\n \r\nBRIEF FOR APPELLEES: \r\n \r\nNick Nicholson \r\nLilian M.",

We affirm. \r\n -3- \r\n The relevant facts are undisputed.  D.L.R. is the biological mother  \r\nand J.D.G. is the legal father1 of L.L.G., J.D.G., Jr., and K.D.G.  L.L.G. was born \r\non May 31, 2019, J.D.G., Jr., was born on April 23, 2020, and K.D.G. was born on \r\nAugust 19, 2021.   \r\n  The Cabinet became involved with D.L.R. and J.D.G. in July of 2020 \r\nwhen it received a report of a social media video showing D.L.R. throwing a cup \r\nof ice in the face of her one-year-old child, L.L.G.  The report also included \r\nconcerns that D.L.R. and J.D.G. were unable to meet the children�s basic needs.  \r\nShortly thereafter, the Cabinet received additional reports that D.L.R. and J.D.G. \r\nwere going into wealthier neighborhoods begging for money.  An investigation \r\nensued, but the Cabinet had difficulty establishing contact with both D.L.R. and \r\nJ.D.G.  A case worker for the Cabinet filed another report in August of 2020 after \r\nobserving D.L.R. walking down a busy road in the heat of the day with L.L.G. and \r\nJ.D.G., Jr.2  The case worker stopped and discovered both children were soiled and \r\nsweating profusely.  The Cabinet immediately negotiated a safety plan with D.L.R. \r\nand J.D.G. that included D.L.R. staying off busy roads with her young children, \r\nJ.D.G. finding employment, D.L.R. and J.D.G. having their water service turned \r\n \r\n1 J.D.G. is the legal father of L.L.G., J.D.G., Jr., and K.D.G. by virtue of causing his name to be \r\nplaced on the children�s birth certificates.  J.D.G. has not pursued an appeal from the order \r\nterminating his parental rights. \r\n \r\n2 At this time, K.D.G. had not yet been born. \r\n -4- \r\nback on, and D.L.R. applying for benefits under the Kentucky Transitional \r\nAssistance Program.  The Cabinet subsequently negotiated a case plan for the \r\nfamily on October 21, 2020.   \r\n Then, on November 2, 2020, the Cabinet received another report \r\nregarding the children.  This report alleged that the children were taken to a \r\ndoctor�s appointment covered in dirt and had broken skin folds on their necks from \r\nlack of bathing.  There were also concerns that J.D.G., Jr., was developmentally \r\ndelayed and not receiving appropriate developmental support.  The report further \r\nstated that J.D.G., Jr., was observed being covered in bug bites and that roaches \r\nwere seen crawling out of his baby stroller.   \r\n The Cabinet attempted a home visit on November 4, 2020, but D.L.R. \r\nand J.D.G. were not there.  A maternal uncle answered the door and allowed the \r\ncase worker inside.  The case worker discovered the home was infested with \r\nroaches, had a strong odor of urine, and still no water service.  When later \r\nquestioned about substance misuse, J.D.G. responded that he had smoked \r\nmarijuana the previous week.  The Cabinet immediately filed a petition and \r\nobtained emergency custody of L.L.G. and J.D.G., Jr.  The Cabinet also filed a \r\ndependency, neglect, and abuse petition alleging the children were abused and/or \r\nneglected pursuant to Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 600.020. \r\n -5- \r\n A temporary removal hearing was conducted on November 6, 2020.  \r\nL.L.G. and J.D.G., Jr., were placed in the temporary custody of the Cabinet.  \r\nD.L.R. and J.D.G. were ordered to cooperate with the Cabinet and with all \r\ntreatment providers.  On January 21, 2021, an adjudication hearing was held in the \r\nLogan Circuit Court.3  At the hearing, D.L.R. and J.D.G. stipulated that L.L.G. and \r\nJ.D.G., Jr., were neglected as a result of the deplorable conditions in the home.",
                        "They further stipulated to the failure to meet the children�s basic needs and \r\nadmitted to the incident involving D.L.R. throwing a cup of ice into the face of \r\nL.L.G. \r\n Following a disposition hearing, by order entered March 4, 2021, \r\nL.L.G. and J.D.G., Jr., were committed to the custody of the Cabinet.  The order \r\nalso adopted the Cabinet�s case plan recommendations which included that D.L.R. \r\ncooperate with the Cabinet, complete a psychological assessment, complete a \r\nsubstance abuse evaluation, maintain stable employment, maintain appropriate \r\nhousing, complete parenting classes, and demonstrate newly acquired parenting \r\nskills during visitation. \r\n On August 19, 2021, a third child, K.D.G., was born to D.L.R.  The \r\nCabinet sought and obtained emergency custody of K.D.G. the day after his birth.  \r\nThe Cabinet also filed a dependency, neglect, and abuse petition wherein it was \r\n \r\n3 Logan County does not have a family court division or judge. \r\n -6- \r\nalleged that K.D.G. was neglected and/or abused due to D.L.R. testing positive for \r\nmarijuana at the time of K.D.G.�s birth, the home remaining in a deplorable \r\ncondition, the substance abuse problem of D.L.R., and the lack of progress by \r\nD.L.R. and J.D.G. on the case plan established regarding L.L.G. and J.D.G., Jr. \r\n A temporary removal hearing was conducted on August 25, 2021.  \r\nThe Cabinet was granted custody of K.D.G., and he was placed in the same foster \r\nhome as L.L.G. and J.D.G., Jr.  At the adjudication hearing on November 4, 2021, \r\nD.L.R. and J.D.G. stipulated that K.D.G. was neglected due to D.L.R.�s marijuana \r\nuse while pregnant and the deplorable condition of the home.  A separate \r\ndispositional hearing was waived, and K.D.G. was committed to the custody of the \r\nCabinet. \r\n The Cabinet filed Petitions for Involuntary Termination of Parental \r\nRights as to all three children on April 22, 2022.  An evidentiary hearing was \r\nconducted on June 27, 2022.  By orders and judgments entered September 23, \r\n2022, D.L.R. and J.D.G.�s parental rights were terminated as to L.L.G., J.D.G., Jr., \r\nand K.D.G.  These appeals follow. \r\n Counsel for D.L.R. tendered to this Court an Anders brief and a \r\nmotion to withdraw as counsel for D.L.R.  In support of the motion, counsel \r\ndirected our attention to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967) and A.C. v. \r\nCabinet for Health and Family Services, 362 S.W.3d 361 (Ky. App. 2012) for the \r\n -7- \r\nproposition that withdrawal from representation is justified where the record \r\ndemonstrates that the appeal is wholly frivolous.  Anders, 386 U.S. 738, as adopted \r\nin this Commonwealth by A.C., 362 S.W.3d 361, provides that when counsel \r\ndetermines an appeal to be without merit, he or she may withdraw from \r\nrepresentation and appellant is then given notice and 30 days leave to file a pro se \r\nbrief or other pleading.  By order entered January 18, 2023, this Court granted \r\nD.L.R. 30 days leave to file a pro se brief; however, D.L.R. did not file a pro se \r\nbrief.  Our review proceeds accordingly. \r\n When a party files an Anders brief in a termination of parental \r\nrights case, this Court is not required to address every conceivable argument that \r\nan appellant could have raised on appeal.  A.C., 362 S.W.3d at 370.  This Court�s \r\nreview is analogous to a palpable error review requiring only that we �ascertain \r\nerror which �affects the substantial rights of a party.��  Id.  (quoting Kentucky \r\nRules of Civil Procedure (CR) 61.02).  \r\n In Kentucky, termination of parental rights is granted upon \r\nsatisfaction, by clear and convincing evidence, of a tripartite test.  Cabinet for \r\nHealth and Family Servs. v. K.H., 423 S.W.3d 204, 209 (Ky. 2014).  First, KRS \r\n625.090(1) requires that a child be adjudged neglected or abused as defined in \r\nKRS 600.020.  Second, KRS 625.090(1)(c) requires that termination must be in the \r\nchild�s best interest.  Third, at least one of the conditions set out in KRS \r\n -8- \r\n625.090(2) must be established.  The circuit court�s judgment terminating parental \r\nrights will be reversed only if clearly erroneous.  CR 52.01; Cabinet for Health & \r\nFamily Servs. v. T.N.H., 302 S.W.3d 658, 663 (Ky. 2010).  The court�s judgment is \r\nnot clearly erroneous if supported by substantial evidence.  Id.  \r\n Pursuant to KRS 600.020:  \r\n(1) �Abused or neglected child� means a child whose \r\nhealth or welfare is harmed or threatened with harm \r\nwhen: \r\n \r\n(a) His or her parent, guardian, person in a position of \r\nauthority or special trust, as defined in KRS 532.045, \r\nor other person exercising custodial control or \r\nsupervision of the child:  \r\n \r\n. . . . \r\n \r\n4. Continuously or repeatedly fails or refuses to \r\nprovide essential parental care and protection for \r\nthe child, considering the age of the child;  \r\n \r\n. . . . \r\n \r\n7. Abandons or exploits the child;  \r\n \r\n8.",
                        "Does not provide the child with adequate care,  \r\nsupervision, food, clothing, shelter, and education \r\nor medical care necessary for the child�s well- \r\nbeing . . . . \r\n \r\n Based on our review of the record before this Court on appeal, the \r\nCabinet presented unrefuted evidence to the circuit court at the evidentiary hearing \r\n -9- \r\nconsistent with the statutory requirements.  The court�s findings were supported by \r\nclear and convincing evidence and thus are not clearly erroneous. \r\n KRS 625.090 provides as follows:  \r\n(2) No termination of parental rights shall be ordered \r\nunless the Circuit Court also finds by clear and \r\nconvincing evidence the existence of one (1) or more of \r\nthe following grounds: \r\n \r\n. . . . \r\n \r\n(e) That the parent, for a period of not less than six (6) \r\nmonths, has continuously or repeatedly failed or \r\nrefused to provide or has been substantially incapable \r\nof providing essential parental care and protection for \r\nthe child and that there is no reasonable expectation of \r\nimprovement in parental care and protection, \r\nconsidering the age of the child; \r\n \r\n. . . . \r\n \r\n(g) That the parent, for reasons other than poverty  \r\nalone, has continuously or repeatedly failed to provide  \r\nor is incapable of providing essential food, clothing, \r\nshelter, medical care, or education reasonably \r\nnecessary and available for the child�s well-being and \r\nthat there is no reasonable expectation of significant \r\nimprovement in the parent�s conduct in the \r\nimmediately foreseeable future, considering the age of \r\nthe child; \r\n \r\n. . . . \r\n \r\n(j) That the child has been in foster care under the \r\nresponsibility of the cabinet for fifteen (15) \r\ncumulative months out of forty-eight (48) months \r\npreceding the filing of the petition to terminate \r\nparental rights[.] \r\n -10- \r\n \r\n As concerns L.L.G., J.D.G., Jr., the circuit court found that the above \r\nthree provisions of KRS 625.090 had been satisfied by the Cabinet.  As concerns \r\nK.D.G., the circuit court found the provisions of KRS 625.090(2)(e) and (g) had \r\nbeen satisfied by the evidence presented.  The circuit court then found that \r\ntermination of D.L.R.�s parental rights was in the best interest of L.L.G., J.D.G., \r\nJr., and K.D.G. based upon a thorough analysis of the evidence as required by KRS \r\n625.090(3).  Again, based upon our review of the record, we cannot conclude that \r\nthe circuit court�s findings of fact were clearly erroneous and must agree that it \r\nwas in the best interest of L.L.G., J.D.G., Jr., and K.D.G. to terminate D.L.R.�s \r\nparental rights. \r\n For the reasons stated, we affirm the Logan Circuit Court�s order \r\nentered November 23, 2022, terminating D.L.R.�s parental rights in Appeal Nos. \r\n2022-CA-1454-ME, 2022-CA-1456-ME, and 2022-CA-1457-ME. \r\n ALL CONCUR. \r\nBRIEFS FOR APPELLANT: \r\n \r\nJustin D.
