The district court abused its discretion by allowing the admission of evidence on direct examination of anonymous, threatening phone calls a witness received before trial when the minimal probative value of the threat evidence was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice that its admission posed to the defendant. 1 2. Because the defendant has not demonstrated a reasonable possibility that the admission of evidence on direct examination of anonymous, threatening phone calls a witness received before trial significantly impacted the jury's verdict, the defendant is not entitled to a new trial.

The district court did not err by denying the defendant's motion to suppress evidence stemming from a genetic analysis of DNA collected from crime scene materials because the defendant had abandoned his subjective expectation of privacy in that information by leaving his semen at the scene of the crime. 2. The district court did not err by denying the defendant's motion to suppress evidence stemming from a genetic analysis of DNA collected from his garbage because law enforcement lawfully and independently obtained identical information from a DNA sample the defendant voluntarily provided. 3. The district court abused its discretion by denying the defendant's motion to present alternative-perpetrator evidence because the defendant's proffered evidence clearly had an inherent tendency to connect the alternative perpetrator to the commission of the crime and could have been admitted under the ordinary rules of evidence, and the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Search warrants authorizing seizure and search of electronic devices were sufficiently particular under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10, of the Minnesota Constitution. 2. The guilty verdict in this case was surely unattributable to the evidence obtained from the search of a law office and so we need not decide whether the warrants to search that law office were executed in an unreasonable manner because any error in the evidence's admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 3. When searching the law office of an attorney who is suspected of a crime, specific procedures to safeguard privileged materials are required under the supervisory powers of the Minnesota Supreme Court.

    "summaries": "1. The district court did not err in concluding that the genetic analysis of a napkin discarded by appellant was not a search because the analysis was only capable of matching appellant's DNA to the DNA found at the crime scene and appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his identifying information. 2. Any error in precluding appellant from presenting alternative-perpetrator evidence at trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 3. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded testimony from appellant's expert as late discovery because the district court properly exercised its authority to respond to violations of the Minnesota Rules of Criminal Procedure. 4. The State did not commit prosecutorial misconduct during its closing argument because none of the prosecutor's statements constituted error. 5. The circumstantial evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury's verdict that appellant was guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, and appellant advances no reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with appellant's guilt. 6. Appellant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his constitutional rights because appellant has not demonstrated that trial counsel's personal interests materially limited the representation, and appellant was not prejudiced by the representation. 7. No cumulative errors denied appellant his right to a fair trial where only one potential error was present, and the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 8. It was error to convict appellant of both first-degree felony murder and the lesser-included offense of second-degree intentional murder. Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.",

The defendant did not invite the district court's error in determining that a witness against him was unavailable under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 6, of the Minnesota Constitution. 3.

Because the court is evenly divided on whether beneficial owners of a closely held corporation may initiate an action for a buy-out of their interests under Minnesota Statutes section 302A.751 (2022), we affirm the decision of the court of appeals dismissing appellants' buy-out claim.

In accord with our decision in Smith v. Carver County, 931 N.W.2d 390, 396\u201397 (Minn. 2019), compensation judges may review the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria when considering the persuasiveness of expert reports, but judges may not use those criteria to make their own diagnosis of a claimant's condition.
