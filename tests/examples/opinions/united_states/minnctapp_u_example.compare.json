We conclude, first, that the district court did not err by determining the presumption of validity applied and, second, that appellant failed to rebut the presumption and overcome the city's prima facie proof. Third, we conclude that appellant forfeited any challenge to the uniformity of the special assessment because he failed to raise the issue in district court; alternatively, we discern no error.
