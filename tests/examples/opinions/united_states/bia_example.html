                            persecution if the respondent can demonstrate that reporting private abuse to government
                            authorities would have been futile or dangerous.</p>

                            or her sexual orientation if removed to his or her native country.</p>

                            protect its citizens. In cases where an asylum applicant is the victim of violence or
                            threats by non-governmental actors, and the applicant’s home government has made efforts to
                            prevent such violence or threats, failures in particular cases or high levels of crime do

                            persecution, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). Under this test, the protected ground: (1) must be
                            a but-for cause of the wrongdoer’s act; and (2) must play more than a minor role—in other
                            words, it cannot be incidental or tangential to another reason for the act.</p>

                          <p align="LEFT">(1) In conducting its review of an alien’s asylum claim, the Board of
                            Immigration Appeals (“Board”) must examine de novo whether the facts found by the
                            immigration judge satisfy all of the statutory elements of asylum as a matter of law. <i>See
                              Matter of R-A-F-</i>, 27 I&amp;N Dec. 778 (A.G. 2020).</p>

                          <p>(2) When reviewing a grant of asylum, the Board should not accept the parties’ stipulations
                            to, or failures to address, any of the particular elements of asylum—including, where
                            necessary, the elements of a particular social group. Instead, unless it affirms without
                            opinion under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(i), the Board should meaningfully review each element
                            of an asylum claim before affirming such a grant, or before independently ordering a grant
                            of asylum. <i>See Matter of L-E-A-</i>, 27 I&amp;N Dec. 581, 589 (A.G. 2019).</p>

                          <p>(3) Even if an applicant is a member of a cognizable particular social group and has
                            suffered persecution, an asylum claim should be denied if the harm inflicted or threatened
                            by the persecutor is not “on account of” the alien’s membership in that group.&nbsp; That
                            requirement is especially important to scrutinize where the asserted particular social group
                            encompasses many millions of persons in a particular society.&nbsp; (4) An alien’s
                            membership in a particular social group cannot be “incidental, tangential, or subordinate to
                            the persecutor’s motivation . . . [for] why the persecutor[] sought to inflict harm.”
                            <i>Matter of A-B-</i>, 27 I&amp;N Dec. 316, 338 (A.G. 2018) (citations omitted).&nbsp;
                            Accordingly, persecution that results from personal animus or retribution generally does not
                            support eligibility for asylum.

                            because [he was] clothed with the authority of . . . law.’" <i>West v. Atkins</i>, 487 U.S.
