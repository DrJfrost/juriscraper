The application asserts that Vassar is subject to removal under Government Code section 1770(b) because he is mentally incapacitated and unable to perform his job duties. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there are substantial issues of law and fact as to whether the requirements of section 1770(b) are satisfied. We further conclude that the public interest will be served by allowing the proposed quo warranto action to proceed. Consequently, the application for leave to sue is GRANTED.

    "summaries": "QUESTIONS: Could state-law authorization, under an agreement pursuant to Chapter 25 of Division 10 of the Business and Professions Code, for medicinal or adult-use commercial cannabis activity, or both, between out-of-state licensees and California licensees \"result in significant legal risk to the State of California under the federal Controlled Substances Act\" within the meaning of Business and Professions Code section 26308(a)(4)? CONCLUSIONS: Yes. State-law authorization for commercial cannabis activity between out-of-state licensees and California licensees could \"result in significant legal risk to the State of California under the federal Controlled Substances Act\" within the meaning of section 26308(a)(4) due to the risks of federal preemption of state law and criminal prosecution of state employees. Courts have disagreed about the scope of federal preemption in the cannabis context, and no court has ever considered a preemption challenge to a state law authorizing interstate cannabis sales. The law is also unsettled as to whether state officials could be federally prosecuted for implementing state law in this area. Official Citation: 106 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 119",

    "summaries": "QUESTIONS: 1. Under state law, may an appointed public member of the City of San Diego Audit Committee concurrently serve as: (a) an appointed public member of the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) TransNet Independent Taxpayer Oversight Committee; (b) an appointed public member of the SANDAG Audit Policy Advisory Committee; or (c) the Internal Auditor of the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System? 2. Would the City Council of San Diego violate state law by appointing a member of the public to the City Audit Committee if doing so would result in the appointee holding incompatible public offices in violation of Government Code section 1099? CONCLUSIONS: 1. As to (a) and (b), an appointed public member of the City Audit Committee may not serve concurrently as an appointed public member of either the SANDAG TransNet Independent Taxpayer Oversight Committee or the SANDAG Audit Policy Advisory Committee. Such concurrent service would violate Government Code section 1099, which prohibits serving in legally incompatible public offices. As to (c), an appointed public member of the City Audit Committee may serve concurrently as the Internal Auditor of the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System without violating section 1099, because the Internal Auditor position is not a public office. Such concurrent service also would not violate Government Code section 1126's prohibition against engaging in incompatible outside activities, unless the City Council determines that serving as the System's Internal Auditor is inconsistent with the duties of a City Audit Committee member. Other state laws prohibiting financial and personal conflicts of interest would not prohibit the concurrent holding of these positions either. Those laws generally apply to particular government transactions or decisions, not the simultaneous holding of government positions, and, in any event, the request does not reference any type of financial or personal conflict. 2. No. The City Council would not violate state law by appointing a member of the public to the City Audit Committee if doing so would result in the appointee holding incompatible public offices in violation of Government Code section 1099. Although section 1099(b) provides that a public official who accepts a second, legally incompatible public office thereby forfeits the first office held, neither section 1099, nor any other authority we are aware of, provides that an appointing authority violates or is subject to any sanction under state law by making such an appointment.

If a California winery owner or manager obtains their own criminal record check from the California Department of Justice, would furnishing that criminal record check\u2014or a notification reflecting that no such record exists\u2014to another state's alcohol control agency violate California Penal Code sections 11125, 11142, or 11143?
