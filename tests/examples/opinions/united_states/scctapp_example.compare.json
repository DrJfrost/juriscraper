    "summaries": "Kenneth R. Gleaton appeals his life sentence and convictions for murder, second degree arson, illegal possession of a firearm, and desecration of human remains. He claims numerous trial errors, including the circuit court's denial of his motion to bifurcate and the handling of certain evidentiary matters. Gleaton further challenges the circuit court's conduct of the trial, such as its refusal to recess late on a Friday afternoon before proceeding with closing arguments and the charge to the jury, as well as the court's failure to hold a proper sentencing proceeding to allow the presentation of mitigation evidence. Finally, Gleaton contends these cumulative errors require that he be granted a new trial. Although the circuit court erred in certain respects during this week-long trial, we find these errors harmless based on our review of the entire record. Thus, we affirm Gleaton's convictions and life sentence.",

Appellant argues the trial court erred by: (1) denying Appellant's motion to suppress evidence obtained as a product of the traffic stop because law enforcement did not have probable cause that a traffic violation had occurred or reasonable suspicion that the occupants of the car were engaged in criminal activity; (2) admitting expert testimony from the State's document examiner that it was \"probable\" the person who wrote the inscription on the back of an envelope found in Appellant's car was the same person whose handwriting appears on Appellant's personnel records obtained from previous employers; and (3) admitting testimony from the State's expert DNA analyst concerning Appellant's inclusion in a mixture of DNA found on a multi-tool, cuttings from a roll of paper towels, and a sample from a pair of pants.

Father argues the family court erred by finding these issues were rendered moot on the ground that the child who was the subject of the underlying modification action turned eighteen before the court was able to hold a final hearing on the modification and contempt actions.

    "summaries": "This case stems from several disputes within the Chandelle Subdivision (Chandelle), a residential aviation community in Spartanburg County. Appellants contend the circuit court erred in granting Respondent Chandelle Property Owners Association's (the POA) motion for partial summary judgment; they assert association bylaws prohibited the POA from incurring debt in excess of $50,000 without a vote of the association and argue the declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions (the Restrictive Covenants) allow annual assessments only for maintenance. Appellants challenge the circuit court's award of the back assessments claimed in the POA's debt collection action; award of \"equitable relief\" before a jury could hear their compulsory legal counterclaims; and failure to require the POA to exhaust other legal remedies. They further argue the circuit court erred in awarding the back assessments before discovery was complete and failed to recognize the claimed assessments are \"ostensibly attorney's fees\" in disguise. We affirm the circuit court's order granting partial summary judgment.",
