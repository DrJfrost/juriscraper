    "summaries": "The defendant, Nicholas Finnigan, appealed from a Superior Court judgment of conviction following a jury-waived trial at which he was found guilty of one count of second-degree child molestation and received a sentence of ten years, with fifty-four months to serve and the remainder suspended, and ten years of probation. On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material testimony regarding the actual date of the alleged incident. The Supreme Court concluded that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive evidence, but rather, acknowledged the inconsistent testimony in the record and determined that it was inconsequential in this particular case. Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.",

    "summaries": "The defendant, Lydia Alicea (defendant or Alicea), pled nolo contendere to the charges brought against her by way of information pursuant to violating G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-41-4. Upon the defendant's plea, the Superior Court imposed a two-year deferred sentence and ordered $1,800 in restitution. The defendant entered into a deferred-sentence agreement with the Office of the Attorney General, thereby agreeing to the terms of her sentence set forth by the Superior Court. The defendant failed to satisfy her restitution obligation of $1,800 by the expiration of her deferred-sentence agreement. Accordingly, a magistrate of the Superior Court declared defendant a violator of her deferred-sentence agreement, imposed a sentence of three years of probation, and ordered that defendant pay $36.15 in monthly installments toward the outstanding restitution amount. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal of the magistrate's decision to a justice of the Superior Court. On November 18, 2022, the trial justice issued a written decision denying the appeal; the stay was vacated, and restitution payments were ordered to resume on December 1, 2022. Thereafter, this timely appeal ensued. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial justice erred in affirming the magistrate's decision\u2014declaring defendant a violator of the deferred-sentence agreement\u2014because the Superior Court did not conduct an adequate hearing concerning whether she had the ability to pay the restitution in accordance with G.L. 1956 \u00a7 12-19-19. The defendant also argued that the trial justice improperly applied State v. Regan, 273 A.3d 116 (R.I. 2022). After examining the record and the parties' arguments, the Supreme Court concluded that defendant was not provided a full evidentiary hearing to determine her ability to pay the court-ordered restitution and vacated the judgment of the Superior Court declaring Alicea to be a violator of her deferred-sentence agreement.",

    "summaries": "In these consolidated administrative appeals, the defendant, the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), filed petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of a Superior Court judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Newport School Committee (Newport) and Cumberland School Committee (Cumberland). The Superior Court reviewed two decisions of the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education (Council) that required each municipality to pay the per-pupil special-education rate to DCYF for the cost of educational services provided to students who were placed by DCYF in residential treatment programs but who were not receiving special-education services. The Council upheld a decision of the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education that determined that the municipalities were required to pay the per-pupil special-education rate pursuant to the unambiguous language of G.L. 1956 \u00a7\u00a7 16-64-1.1 and 16-64-1.2. The Superior Court disagreed, granting Newport and Cumberland's appeal and finding that the clear and unambiguous language of \u00a7 16-64-1.1(c) required the designated city or town to pay no more than \"its share of the cost of educational services to DCYF\" which in these cases, was the per-pupil general-education rate. Reviewing the statute de novo, the Supreme Court determined that \u00a7 16-64-1.1 and \u00a7 16-64-1.2 are devoid of language requiring municipalities to reimburse DCYF at the per-pupil special-education rate when the child in question is not actually receiving special-education services. Instead, the statutes use the term \"per-pupil special-education cost\" which, by its plain meaning, refers to the amount given in exchange for services rendered. Therefore, because there were no special-education services rendered, the municipalities were not required to reimburse at the special-education rate. The Supreme Court reasoned, however, that supplemental briefing was necessary to determine what reimbursements, if any, DCYF should receive for the educational cost of non-special-education students placed in residential treatment programs that include the delivery of educational services. Therefore, the Supreme Court directed the parties to file supplemental briefs to resolve this issue.",

    "summaries": "The plaintiff, John Armour, individually and as personal representative of the Estate of Judith Armour, appealed from the denial of his motion for a new trial following a verdict for the defendants David Bader, M.D., Neil Brandon, M.D., and South County Hospital Healthcare System d.b.a. South County Cardiology in a medical negligence case. The plaintiff challenged the trial justice's refusal to give a jury instruction pursuant to the instruction affirmed by this Court in Oliveira v. Jacobson, 846 A.2d 822 (R.I. 2004). The plaintiff also claimed that the trial justice erred in permitting the defendants' standard-of-care expert to utilize a referring doctor's records as a basis for his opinions and in limiting cross-examination of that expert regarding a particular study. The Supreme Court held that the trial justice erred in denying the plaintiff's motion for a new trial because (1) the jury should have been instructed that it would be improper to consider the nonparty referring physician's conduct in assessing the defendants' negligence in this case; (2) allowing the defendants' standard-of-care expert to rely on the specific content of the referring physician's records, a primary-care provider, to support the defendant-cardiologists' actions on the date of the decedent's stress test, when they were admittedly not available to the defendants, was an abuse of discretion; and (3) it was an error to preclude the plaintiff's attorney from referencing a particular study by name on cross-examination of the defendants' expert because, although outside the scope of direct examination, it would have tended to contradict the expert's testimony that the decedent was stable on the date of her stress echocardiogram. Accordingly, the Court vacated the judgment of the Superior Court and remanded the case for a new trial.",

    "summaries": "The plaintiff, Marcia Sallum Glassie, appealed from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the defendant, Paul Doucette, in his capacity as Executor of the Estate of Donelson C. Glassie. The Superior Court affirmed the Newport Probate Court's denial of the plaintiff's 2019 petition for leave to file a claim out of time against the estate. The statute governing such claims is G.L. 1956 \u00a7 33-11-5, which permits claims out of time against an estate when the claimant failed to make a timely claim by reason of excusable neglect, among other grounds. Relevant to the appeal, the trial justice found that the plaintiff had notice of her claim in 2012 and that it was not excusable neglect for her to wait seven years before seeking to file that claim. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the trial justice incorrectly found that her claim accrued in 2012; she also contended that, even if her claim accrued in 2012, it was subject to the general ten-year statute of limitations and not \u00a7 33-11-5. The Supreme Court not only held that the plaintiff had notice of her claim in 2012 and that \u00a7 33-11-5 applied to her claim, but also declined to disturb the factual findings of the trial justice concerning the issue of excusable neglect. Accordingly, the Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.",
