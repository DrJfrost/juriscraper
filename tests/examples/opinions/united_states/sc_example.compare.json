We also find the trial court acted within its discretion in allocating the proceeds of pretrial settlements for the purpose of setoff. We affirm.",

The trial court refused the State's request for a jury instruction that, under section 16-3-657 of the South Carolina Code (2015), the testimony of an alleged victim of criminal sexual conduct need not be corroborated. However, over Cone's objection, the trial court allowed the State to cite and quote the statute during its closing argument. The court of appeals affirmed Cone's conviction, holding the issue of whether the State could argue section 16-3-657 was unpreserved. We granted Cone's petition for a writ of certiorari and now reverse the court of appeals and remand for a new trial.",

The answer is \"No.\" Categorically, if any such files or records meet the criteria for civil discovery under Rules 26 to 37 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, then \"good cause\" exists under section 63-9-780 as to those files or records. We have no concern that civil discovery of the files or records will jeopardize their confidentiality because the circuit or family court can and must preserve that confidentiality through the use of an appropriate protective order under Rule 26(c). We reverse the court of appeals' decision affirming the trial court's refusal to require disclosure of the documents.",
