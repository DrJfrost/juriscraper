The parties are advised to review and strictly comply with the Court's standing order concerning initial status conferences and the filing of the initial status report (which, in this case, will be due no later than 9/26/16). The standing order and the template for the initial status report are available on the Court's homepage at www.ilnd.uscourts.gov. By way of preliminary information, the Court expects attorneys to appear at all set dates. If an attorney has a conflict with a set date, the attorney must notify Judge Blakey's Courtroom Deputy, Gloria Lewis, at (312) 818-6699. If appropriate, the Court will then reset the matter. Advising opposing counsel of a conflict is not a substitute for communicating with the Court. Attorneys who fail to appear and fail to notify the Courtroom Deputy of any conflict may be subject to sanctions. Additionally, the parties are strongly encouraged to consider consenting to proceed before the assigned United States Magistrate Judge. Should the parties elect to do so, they should notify Mrs. Lewis, and the case will be reassigned upon receipt of the signed consent form. Mailed notice (gel, )",
