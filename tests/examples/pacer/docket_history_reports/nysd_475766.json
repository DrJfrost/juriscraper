Upon the application of the United States of America, with the consent of the undersigned counsel, and the defendants having requested discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16, the Court hereby finds and orders as follows: 1. Disclosure Material. The Government has made and will make disclosure to the defendants of documents, objects and information, including electronically stored information (\"ESI\"), pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, and the Government's general obligation to produce exculpatory and impeachment material in criminal cases, all of which will be referred to herein as \"disclosure material.\" The Government's disclosure material may include material that (i) affects the privacy, confidentiality and business interests of individuals and entities not named as parties in this case; (ii) would impede, if prematurely disclosed, the Government's ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals; (iii) would risk prejudicial pretrial publicity if publicly disseminated; and (iv) that is not authorized to be disclosed to the public or disclosed beyond that which is necessary for the defense of this criminal case. 2. Sensitive Disclosure Material. Certain of the Government's disclosure material, referred to herein as \"sensitive disclosure material,\" contains information that identifies, or could lead to the identification of, witnesses who may be subject to intimidation or obstruction, and whose lives, persons, and property, as well as the lives, persons, and property of loved ones, will be subject to risk of harm absent the protective considerations set forth herein. The Government's designation of material as sensitive disclosure material will be controlling absent contrary order of the Court. 3. Good Cause. There is good cause for entry of the protective order set forth herein. Accordingly it is hereby Ordered: 4. Disclosure material shall not be disclosed by the defendants or each of his defense counsel, including any successor counsel (\"the defense\") other than as set forth herein, and shall be used by the defense solely for purposes of defending this action. The defense shall not post any disclosure material on any Internet site or network site to which persons other than the parties hereto have access, and shall not disclose any disclosure material to the media or any third party except as set forth below. 5. Disclosure material may be disclosed by counsel to:...[See this Protective Order]... Return or Destruction of Material: 12. Except for disclosure material that has been made part of the record of this case, the defense shall return to the Government or securely destroy or delete all disclosure material, including the seized ESI disclosure material, within 30 days of the expiration of the period for direct appeal from any verdict in the above-captioned case; the period of direct appeal from any order dismissing any of the charges in the above-captioned case; or the granting of any motion made on behalf of the Government dismissing any charges in the above-captioned case, whichever date is later. Retention of Jurisdiction: 13. The provisions of this order shall not terminate at the conclusion of this prosecution and the Court will retain jurisdiction to enforce this Order following termination of the case.
