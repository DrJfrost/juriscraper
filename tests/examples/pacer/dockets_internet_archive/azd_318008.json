      "description": "ORDER denying 153 Motion to Supplement. Soilworks has not satisfied the very demanding \"manifest injustice\" standard established by the Court's Order Setting Trial and by Rule 16(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The materials submitted by Midwest (Dkt. #154) show that Soilworks was aware during the course of discovery that Midwest claimed that Durasoil infringed because it contained a synthetic isoalkane and a binder consisting of a carboxylic acid, an ester, or a thermoplastic polyolefin. To the extent Midwest's claims were somewhat imprecise (as the Court recognized at the final pretrial conference), Soilworks had the power to invoke the Court's assistance and require Midwest to clarify its discovery responses. Soilworks never did so. Because Soilworks could have identified the need for and produced the proposed expert witness in accordance with the Court's discovery schedule, the Court will not allow Soilworks to do so on the eve of trial.
