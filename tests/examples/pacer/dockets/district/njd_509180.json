In all three matters, Plaintiffs requested that the Court impose the deadline for Defendants to produce Federal Drug Administration correspondence pursuant to L. Pat. R. 3.6(j)(2). Defendants Teva Pharms., Inc., et al. and Annora Pharma Private Ltd., et al. requested an extension to the Rule in their Joint Discovery Plans (to allow 14 days), and Defendants Lupin Ltd., et al. orally asserted the same request during the Rule 16 conference. The Court has considered the parties' arguments and has concluded that there is not a sufficient reason to deviate from the 7-day rule required under L. Pat. R. 3.6(j)(2).
